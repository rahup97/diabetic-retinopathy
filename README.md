# diabetic-retinopathy
This is our project for the ZEISS hackathon conducted in January 2018.

Used image processing techniques; SIFT algorithm along with background subtraction and thresholding techniques to process Fundus images and identify lesions. Developed an Android application that connects the patients to doctors to allow for a remote diagnosis of Diabetic Retinopathy.

The Android App developed for this solution can be found [here](https://github.com/shreyasar2202/diab-retinopathy-android).

## Note
The demo Fundus images have been provided to us by ZEISS, and we have got the required permission to use them in our project.
